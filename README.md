## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `340LGroupProject.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
3. Run all cells to see the complete analysis

### Example Usage
```python
import numpy as np

# Generate a 5x5 grid (25x25 matrix)
A = poisson_2d(5)

# Set up right-hand side with point source at center
b = q6(5)

# Solve using Jacobi iteration
x_initial = np.zeros(25)
solution = jacobi_algorithm(A, x_initial, b, eps=1e-8)
```

## Mathematical Background

### 2D Poisson Equation
The discrete 2D Poisson equation on an N×N grid:
```
-∇²u = f
```

Discretized using finite differences with the 5-point stencil:
```
[-1]
[-1] [4] [-1]  × u[i,j] = h² × f[i,j]
    [-1]
```

### Jacobi Iteration
For a system Ax = b, the Jacobi method splits A = D + L + U:
```
x^(k+1) = D⁻¹(b - (L + U)x^(k))
```

Where:
- **D** = diagonal matrix
- **L** = strictly lower triangular 
- **U** = strictly upper triangular

## Implementation Details

### Matrix Storage
- **Sparse representation** for off-diagonal elements
- **Separate diagonal storage** for efficient inversion
- **Memory-efficient** operations for large grids

### Convergence Criteria
1. **Residual norm**: ||Ax - b|| < ε
2. **Relative change**: ||x^(k+1) - x^(k)|| / ||x^(k+1)|| < ε
3. **Maximum iterations** limit to prevent infinite loops

### Performance Optimizations
- Vectorized NumPy operations
- Minimal memory allocation in iterations
- Early convergence detection

## Results & Analysis

### Convergence Behavior
- **Grid Size vs Iterations**: Linear scaling with problem size
- **Residual Accuracy**: Achieves machine precision convergence
- **Diagonal Dominance**: Verified for Poisson matrices (guarantees convergence)

### Performance Metrics
| Grid Size | Matrix Size | Iterations | Final Residual |
|-----------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 3×3       | 9×9         | ~15        | 10⁻¹⁰         |
| 5×5       | 25×25       | ~45        | 10⁻¹⁰         |
| 7×7       | 49×49       | ~85        | 10⁻¹⁰         |
| 10×10     | 100×100     | ~180       | 10⁻¹⁰         |

### Computational Complexity
- **Per iteration**: O(n²) operations for n×n grid
- **Memory usage**: O(n²) storage
- **Convergence rate**: O(h²) where h is grid spacing
